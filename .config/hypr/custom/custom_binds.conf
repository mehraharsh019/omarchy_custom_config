# Before creating your custom binds, make sure to
# unbind existing binds that may conflict with your new ones.

# Even if the default binds are not listed here, they may still be active.

# Even if your intended keybind isn't already bound, it's a good idea to
# unbind it first to avoid conflicts during future omarchy or config updates.

# If you want to change the bind of a action already bound by default,
# it is better to unbind it to avoid duplicate binds and it also frees up the keybind.
